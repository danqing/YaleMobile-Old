YaleMobile-Old
==============

This is version 2.0 - 2.0.4 of YaleMobile, the iOS app for Yale University students. It is designed for iOS 6.x, and is now deprecated. It does not *really* work for iOS 7. It is also the last version created solely by me.

Version 2.9 of YaleMobile is the current version and supports iOS 7/8. It is available at kiokoo/YaleMobile. It is largely based on this repo, but additions are made by other developers. Please see its credits page for details.
